# VillagerNerfer

A little Minecraft plugin inspired by the VillagerLobotomizatorNator plugin. 1x1 hole detection has been improved and several more supporting commands have been introduced, making this plugin work as a standalone sulution for villager lag. Uses api calls that work only on Paper. Tested on paper-170 to paper-184.
